# Sieve of Erastothenes

The code used in this program was originally created in [Source §4](https://sourceacademy.org/playground), and modified to work with JS. The program runs with a time complexity of Θ(n), as verified [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aznp6B2_jEbNs8LgRau_RTAvDAu2hnkwvnv2koVfU4Y/edit?usp=sharing). 

While my program logs the sum of primes below an input `n`, it can be modified to return an array of primes under `n`, or even the array of `n` primes, which I will implement at a later date.
