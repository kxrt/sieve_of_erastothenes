# Sieve of Erastothenes

The code used in these programs were originally created in [Source §4](https://sourceacademy.org/playground), and modified to work with JS. The programs run with a time complexity of `O(n•log(log(n)))`, as verified [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aznp6B2_jEbNs8LgRau_RTAvDAu2hnkwvnv2koVfU4Y/edit?usp=sharing). 

* `sieve_last_num.js` logs the highest prime number below an input number.
* `sieve_sum.js` logs the sum of prime numbers below an input number.
